Integrating cutting-edge medical technology into existing healthcare practices presents a dual challenge: ensuring its clinical efficacy and making it a viable, billable service. Success hinges not just on the brilliance of the innovation, but on its seamless integration into the day-to-day operations and financial structures of medical facilities.

I've recently consulted with an EEG company that has developed technology with impressive diagnostic promise that expanded applications beyond seizures and into detection of various psychiatric pathologies. A challenge here is that psychiatrists or primary care physicians who would benefit from using the technology do not receive much training in EEG interpretation.

In today's AI revolution, it's natural to say, "AI can do the interpretation on behalf of physicians who can't do the interpretation themselves." This approach will probably become viable within the next 5-10 years, but for now, it has a fatal flaw: the billing codes associated with EEG procedures require human interpretation.

In the current fee-for-service model, clinical processes must fit into CPT codes that can then be negotiated and reimbursed by payers. Here are some of the considerations I think about when developing a deployment strategy for a new health technology.

### The Stakeholder Landscape

A truly effective technology deployment considers the diverse needs of all involved parties:

*   **Patients:** Seeking accurate diagnoses, effective treatments, and a smooth, reassuring experience.
*   **Providers:** Focused on patient care, efficient workflows, and reliable tools that enhance their diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities.
*   **Technicians and Staff:** Requiring user-friendly equipment and clear protocols that enable them to administer tests effectively and consistently.
*   **Administrators:** Concerned with return on investment, operational efficiency, compliance, and ensuring the financial health of the practice through successful billing and reimbursement.

Addressing these varied perspectives is crucial for widespread adoption and sustained growth.

### Key Pillars for Successful Technology Deployment

Successful health tech integration extends beyond the core product to encompass the entire operational ecosystem.

#### Ease of Use for Technicians & Providers

The initial touchpoint with any new technology is often its usability. Hardware that "just works" and is perceived as reliable and easy to operate by technicians forms a strong foundation. Similarly, intuitive software interfaces that align with a provider's existing "muscle memory" reduce the learning curve and foster quicker adoption. Reports generated by the technology must not only be accurate but also specifically useful, integrating smoothly into clinical decision-making processes and supporting diagnostic workflows.


#### The Crucial Role of Billing Support

Now that we have a solution that can be administered easily and has clinical benefit, we need to fit this into a billable clinical workflow. For EEG, two important codes are 95812 and 95816. These codes cover different durations of EEG recordings. The important shared components are that it covers both the administration and the interpretation of the test and that AI interpretation alone is explicitly not reimbursible. Because a provider spending more time on interpretation does not allow them to upcode and increase reimbursement, clinical review must be a streamlined, efficient process. Otherwise, provider time, one of the most expensive assets of a practice, is squandered on a fixed revenue task.  

For this client, I recommended a user experience that allows a provider to view an AI analysis and the raw recording side-by-side with the ability to annotate and make notes. This way, a final report can be produced which includes the length of the recording as well as the manual assessment of the provider, completing the billable encounter.


### Conclusion

Ultimately, the successful deployment of new healthcare technology is a holistic endeavor. It requires meticulous attention to the clinical workflow, user experience, and, critically, the financial viability of the service it enables. By deeply integrating into practice operations and actively supporting the creation of billable services, health technology can truly transform patient care and foster sustainable growth.
