    "text": "TidyTuesday is a weekly data visualization challenge. The details for this week can be found here.\n\n\nAnalysing literature with data science and numerical methods is a fun journey. A few years ago I read Nabokov’s favorite word is mauve by Ben Blatt. The methods for quantifying literature are both interesting and compelling, and I’m interested in seeing if there are similar patterns here. Sidenote: that book was described to me as “the most NPR book ever,” and I love that.\nMy first step is to explore samples of the data to see if it’s usable as is.  \n\nbooks &lt;- data |&gt;\n  distinct(book) |&gt;\n  mutate(publish_order = row_number())\n\n\n\ntext_sample &lt;- data[2000:2100,]\n\ntext_sample |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Text\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Text\n\n\nbook\ntext\nline_num\n\n\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'You had best tell me all about it now,' I said. 'Half-confidences\n2000\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nare worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of\n2001\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nit.'\n2002\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2003\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'On your head be it, Alice!' cried her mother; and then, turning to\n2004\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nme, 'I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on\n2005\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nbehalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand\n2006\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nin this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\n2007\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhowever, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\n2008\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nbe compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high\n2009\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ncharacter, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.'\n2010\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2011\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered.\n2012\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n'Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.'\n2013\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2014\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and\n2015\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nher daughter withdrew. 'Now, sir,' she continued, 'I had no intention\n2016\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nof telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it\n2017\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nI have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you\n2018\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nall without omitting any particular.'\n2019\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2020\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'It is your wisest course,' said I.\n2021\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2022\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\n2023\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\n2024\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nnoticed a \"Copenhagen\" label upon each of their trunks, showing that\n2025\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\n2026\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\n2027\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night\n2028\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nof his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed,\n2029\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nafter twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be\n2030\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free\n2031\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nand familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude\n2032\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ntowards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way\n2033\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwhich, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one\n2034\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noccasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her--an\n2035\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noutrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his\n2036\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nunmanly conduct.'\n2037\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2038\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked. 'I suppose that you can\n2039\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nget rid of your boarders when you wish.'\n2040\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2041\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. 'Would to God\n2042\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthat I had given him notice on the very day that he came,' she said.\n2043\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n'But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day\n2044\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\neach--fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a\n2045\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwidow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the\n2046\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nmoney. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I\n2047\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ngave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his\n2048\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ngoing.'\n2049\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2050\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Well?'\n2051\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2052\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\n2053\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\n2054\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\n2055\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas,\n2056\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nin less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that\n2057\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nMr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the\n2058\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nworse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting\n2059\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwith my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed\n2060\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhis train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed\n2061\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto her that she should fly with him. \"You are of age,\" he said, \"and\n2062\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never\n2063\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nmind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You\n2064\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshall live like a princess.\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she\n2065\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured\n2066\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son\n2067\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nArthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard\n2068\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to\n2069\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nraise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the\n2070\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ndoorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \"I don't think that fine\n2071\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nfellow will trouble us again,\" he said. \"I will just go after him and\n2072\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsee what he does with himself.\" With those words he took his hat and\n2073\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nstarted off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr.\n2074\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nDrebber's mysterious death.'\n2075\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2076\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and\n2077\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the\n2078\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwords. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that\n2079\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere should be no possibility of a mistake.\"\n2080\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2081\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"It's quite exciting,\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \"What\n2082\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhappened next?\"\n2083\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2084\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\" the detective continued, \"I saw that\n2085\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\n2086\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwhich I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour\n2087\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nher son returned.\n2088\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2089\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'I do not know,' she answered.\n2090\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2091\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Not know?'\n2092\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2093\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.'\n2094\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2095\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'After you went to bed?'\n2096\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2097\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Yes.'\n2098\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2099\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'When did you go to bed?'\n2100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The most remarkable thing from the sample is that each observation represents a literal line in the novel. The lines can be concatenated so that each observation is a paragraph. This will be particularly useful in understanding dialog because it is typical in literature to start a new paragraph each time a speaker changes. The NAs between lines mean we have a good boundary between paragraphs.\nAdditionally, I cross-referenced the novel order with the Canon of Sherlock Holmes in order to understand the order in which these works were published. I think it could be interesting to see if there are changes that occur between earlier works and later works.  \n\nparagraphs &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(paragraph = cumsum(is.na(text))) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(text)) |&gt;\n  group_by(book,paragraph) |&gt;\n  summarize(text = paste(text, collapse = \" \"))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'book'.

Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?\"\n\n\n7456\n\"There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to reason. You see my point?\"\n\n\n7457\nHolmes sprang from his chair.\n\n\n7458\n\"Get behind him, Watson! Don't let him out! Now, sir, let us see the contents of that note-book.\"\n\n\n7459\nMilverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and stood with his back against the wall.\n\n\n7460\n\"Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,\" he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. \"I have been expecting you to do something original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mistaken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.\" He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.\n\n\n7461\nHolmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. \"I'll be back some time, Watson,\" said he, and vanished into the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take.\n\n\n7462\nFor some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion.\n\n\n7463\n\"You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?\"\n\n\n7464\n\"No, indeed!\"\n\n\n7465\n\"You'll be interested to hear that I am engaged.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe analysis from Blatt that I’m interested in replicating is his exclamation point analysis.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald and Earnest Hemingway were known for their very resvered use of exclamation points. Fizgerald describes it as “Laughing at your own joke.” We can use this data to determine how well Arthur Conan Doyle follows this rule.  \n\nexclamation_points &lt;- paragraphs |&gt;\n  mutate(exclamation_points = str_count(text, \"!\"))\n\nexclamation_point_sample &lt;- exclamation_points |&gt;\n  filter(exclamation_points &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\n### showing some example lines as a sanity check to make sure our code is working\n\nexclamation_point_sample |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Lines with Exclamation Points\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Lines with Exclamation Points\n\n\nbook\nparagraph\ntext\nexclamation_points\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\n3585\n\"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well.

How many exclamation marks can I get in this post?! 😂\n\n— Libby Heeren (@libbyheeren.bsky.social) November 24, 2025 at 10:02 AM\n\n\n\nIndeed, just because I only included the short stories in the previous visualisation does not mean that all of Doyle’s short stories are same length, and therefore, the absolute count comparision might not necessarily be fair. That said, there is one more method for normalization that is also worth considering. Hemingway would argue that most exclamation points should be replaced with periods. In addition to the above suggestion, I will also normalize by the dividing the sum of terminal periods and exclamation points. This one is a bit more tricky. I don’t want to count “Dr.” or “1.” as sentences. To correct for this, I will count periods immediately after a word that has at least one lowercase vowel.\n\nexclamation_points_normalization &lt;- paragraphs |&gt;\n  mutate(exclamation_points = str_count(text, \"!\"),\n         words = lengths(str_split(text, \" \")),\n         terminal_periods = str_count(text, \"\\\\b\\\\w*[aeiou]\\\\w*\\\\.\") #thanks chatGPT\n         )\nsample &lt;- exclamation_points_normalization |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  filter(exclamation_points &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  filter(terminal_periods &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n=5)\n\nsample |&gt; #Trust but verify\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Punctuation and Word Counts\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Punctuation and Word Counts\n\n\nbook\nparagraph\ntext\nexclamation_points\nwords\nterminal_periods\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\n6820\n\"Enough of this,\" said my friend, coldly. \"Drop that pistol!

    "text": "TidyTuesday is a weekly data visualization challenge. The details for this week can be found here.\n\n\nAnalysing literature with data science and numerical methods is a fun journey. A few years ago I read Nabokov’s favorite word is mauve by Ben Blatt. The methods for quantifying literature are both interesting and compelling, and I’m interested in seeing if there are similar patterns here. Sidenote: that book was described to me as “the most NPR book ever,” and I love that.\nMy first step is to explore samples of the data to see if it’s usable as is.  \n\nbooks &lt;- data |&gt;\n  distinct(book) |&gt;\n  mutate(publish_order = row_number())\n\n\n\ntext_sample &lt;- data[2000:2100,]\n\ntext_sample |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Text\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Text\n\n\nbook\ntext\nline_num\n\n\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'You had best tell me all about it now,' I said. 'Half-confidences\n2000\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nare worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of\n2001\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nit.'\n2002\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2003\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'On your head be it, Alice!' cried her mother; and then, turning to\n2004\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nme, 'I will tell you all, sir. Do not imagine that my agitation on\n2005\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nbehalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand\n2006\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nin this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\n2007\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhowever, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\n2008\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nbe compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high\n2009\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ncharacter, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.'\n2010\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2011\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered.\n2012\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n'Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.'\n2013\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2014\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and\n2015\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nher daughter withdrew. 'Now, sir,' she continued, 'I had no intention\n2016\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nof telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it\n2017\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nI have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you\n2018\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nall without omitting any particular.'\n2019\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2020\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'It is your wisest course,' said I.\n2021\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2022\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\n2023\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\n2024\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nnoticed a \"Copenhagen\" label upon each of their trunks, showing that\n2025\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\n2026\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\n2027\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night\n2028\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nof his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed,\n2029\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nafter twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be\n2030\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free\n2031\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nand familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude\n2032\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ntowards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way\n2033\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwhich, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one\n2034\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noccasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her--an\n2035\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noutrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his\n2036\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nunmanly conduct.'\n2037\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2038\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked. 'I suppose that you can\n2039\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nget rid of your boarders when you wish.'\n2040\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2041\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. 'Would to God\n2042\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthat I had given him notice on the very day that he came,' she said.\n2043\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n'But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day\n2044\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\neach--fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a\n2045\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwidow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the\n2046\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nmoney. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I\n2047\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ngave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his\n2048\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ngoing.'\n2049\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2050\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Well?'\n2051\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2052\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\n2053\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\n2054\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\n2055\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas,\n2056\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nin less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that\n2057\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nMr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the\n2058\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nworse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting\n2059\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwith my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed\n2060\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhis train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed\n2061\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto her that she should fly with him. \"You are of age,\" he said, \"and\n2062\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never\n2063\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nmind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You\n2064\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshall live like a princess.\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she\n2065\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured\n2066\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son\n2067\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nArthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard\n2068\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to\n2069\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nraise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the\n2070\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ndoorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \"I don't think that fine\n2071\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nfellow will trouble us again,\" he said. \"I will just go after him and\n2072\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsee what he does with himself.\" With those words he took his hat and\n2073\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nstarted off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr.\n2074\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nDrebber's mysterious death.'\n2075\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2076\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and\n2077\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the\n2078\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwords. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that\n2079\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere should be no possibility of a mistake.\"\n2080\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2081\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"It's quite exciting,\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \"What\n2082\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhappened next?\"\n2083\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2084\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\" the detective continued, \"I saw that\n2085\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\n2086\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwhich I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour\n2087\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nher son returned.\n2088\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2089\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'I do not know,' she answered.\n2090\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2091\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Not know?'\n2092\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2093\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.'\n2094\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2095\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'After you went to bed?'\n2096\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2097\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Yes.'\n2098\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2099\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'When did you go to bed?'\n2100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  The most remarkable thing from the sample is that each observation represents a literal line in the novel. The lines can be concatenated so that each observation is a paragraph. This will be particularly useful in understanding dialog because it is typical in literature to start a new paragraph each time a speaker changes. The NAs between lines mean we have a good boundary between paragraphs.\nAdditionally, I cross-referenced the novel order with the Canon of Sherlock Holmes in order to understand the order in which these works were published. I think it could be interesting to see if there are changes that occur between earlier works and later works.  \n\nparagraphs &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(paragraph = cumsum(is.na(text))) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(text)) |&gt;\n  group_by(book,paragraph) |&gt;\n  summarize(text = paste(text, collapse = \" \"))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'book'.

Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?\"\n\n\n7456\n\"There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to reason. You see my point?\"\n\n\n7457\nHolmes sprang from his chair.\n\n\n7458\n\"Get behind him, Watson! Don't let him out! Now, sir, let us see the contents of that note-book.\"\n\n\n7459\nMilverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and stood with his back against the wall.\n\n\n7460\n\"Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,\" he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. \"I have been expecting you to do something original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mistaken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.\" He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.\n\n\n7461\nHolmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. \"I'll be back some time, Watson,\" said he, and vanished into the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take.\n\n\n7462\nFor some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion.\n\n\n7463\n\"You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?\"\n\n\n7464\n\"No, indeed!\"\n\n\n7465\n\"You'll be interested to hear that I am engaged.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe analysis from Blatt that I’m interested in replicating is his exclamation point analysis.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald and Earnest Hemingway were known for their very resvered use of exclamation points. Fizgerald describes it as “Laughing at your own joke.” We can use this data to determine how well Arthur Conan Doyle follows this rule.  \n\nexclamation_points &lt;- paragraphs |&gt;\n  mutate(exclamation_points = str_count(text, \"!\"))\n\nexclamation_point_sample &lt;- exclamation_points |&gt;\n  filter(exclamation_points &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\n### showing some example lines as a sanity check to make sure our code is working\n\nexclamation_point_sample |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Lines with Exclamation Points\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Lines with Exclamation Points\n\n\nbook\nparagraph\ntext\nexclamation_points\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Noble Bachelor\n3585\n\"Without, however, the knowledge of pre-existing cases which serves me so well.

That said, there is one more method for normalization that is also worth considering. Hemingway would argue that most exclamation points should be replaced with periods. In addition to the above suggestion, I will also normalize by the dividing the sum of terminal periods and exclamation points. This one is a bit more tricky. I don’t want to count “Dr.” or “1.” as sentences. To correct for this, I will count periods immediately after a word that has at least one lowercase vowel.\n\nexclamation_points_normalization &lt;- paragraphs |&gt;\n  mutate(exclamation_points = str_count(text, \"!\"),\n         words = lengths(str_split(text, \" \")),\n         terminal_periods = str_count(text, \"\\\\b\\\\w*[aeiou]\\\\w*\\\\.\") #thanks chatGPT\n         )\nsample &lt;- exclamation_points_normalization |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  filter(exclamation_points &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  filter(terminal_periods &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n=5)\n\nsample |&gt; #Trust but verify\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Punctuation and Word Counts\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Punctuation and Word Counts\n\n\nbook\nparagraph\ntext\nexclamation_points\nwords\nterminal_periods\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Solitary Cyclist\n6820\n\"Enough of this,\" said my friend, coldly. \"Drop that pistol!

    "text": "I occasionally peruse available Kaggle competitions to see if there’s something fun to explore. This week, I came across this competition around converting EKG images into time series data. This piqued my interest because context can give such a big advantage over a pure ML approach. I’m going to walk through some basics of EKGs and hopefully we can extract some time series data without using any ML. That said, there is obviously a place for computer vision to do a lot of the work that I’m going to write more deterministic code for.\n\nReyna et al. (2025)\n\nRed squares\nBefore even looking at the actual signal, I’m interested in the red lines. Here’s a good explanation from Wikipedia. We can use the red line to build our coordinate system and from there, identify time and voltage values for the actual ekg signal.\n\nKuhn, Stannered, and MoodyGroove (2007)\nFirst, let’s pull out the red channel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Red channel of ECG grid\n\n\n\nI was surprised to see that we pretty much eliminated the grid here. This is still helpful though. Lets find a line with no EKG signal and no writing.\n\n## convert to a matrix\n\nred_matrix &lt;- as.integer(image_data(red))\n\n## find the number of pixels in each row with &gt;200 value\n\nhigh_value_rows &lt;- red_matrix[,,1] |&gt;\n  apply(1, function(x) sum(x &gt; 200))\nhigh_value_rows &lt;- tibble(count = high_value_rows) |&gt;\n  mutate(row = max(row_number()) - row_number() + 1)\n\nempty_row_graph &lt;- ggplot(high_value_rows, aes(x = row, y = count)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  annotation_raster(red, xmin = 0, xmax = 1700, ymin = 0, ymax = 2200) +\n  geom_line(color = \"red\") +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = 1298), color = \"blue\")\n    \nempty_row_graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot overlay, we can now see where there is writing and signal and where there is nothing but grid. Let’s now find a horizontal line without signal. I added a blue line that I’ll use to measure my grid. I’ll use the blue channel for this one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Blue channel of ECG grid\n\n\n\n\nblue_matrix &lt;- as.integer(image_data(blue))\n\n\nhorizontal_lines &lt;- blue_matrix[502, , 1]\n## create a 3 column tibble with one column being the row number, the second column number, and the third column the value\nhorizontal_lines &lt;- tibble(\n  column = seq(1, 2200),\n  row = 502,\n  value = horizontal_lines)\ngrid_plot &lt;- ggplot(horizontal_lines, aes(x = column, y = value)) +\n  geom_line()\n\ngrid_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlet’s zoom in and add the blue channel underneath.\n\ncrop_blue &lt;- image_crop(blue, \"300x95+1200+450\")\n\nzoomed_in &lt;- grid_plot +\n  lims(x = c(1200, 1500), y = c(0, 350)) +\n  annotation_raster(crop_blue, xmin = 1200, xmax = 1500, ymin = 255, ymax = 350)\n\nzoomed_in\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEverything lines up perfectly. We can take the indeces of our minima and calculate a time per pixel for our x-axis and a mV per pixel for our y-axis.\n\nhorizontal_lines_minima &lt;- horizontal_lines |&gt;\n  filter(!(column %in% c(1, 2200))) |&gt;\n  filter(value &lt; 20) |&gt;\n  mutate(next_minima = lead(column)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(next_minima)) |&gt;\n  mutate(diff = next_minima - column)\n\nbig_box_width &lt;- mean(horizontal_lines_minima$diff)\n\nThe width of one big box is 39.4 pixels, which is equal to 200ms horizontally and 0.5mV vertically. Now let’s start tracing the signal itself.\n\n\nFinding the signals\nFor this, we’re going to go back to the red channel. We’ll use our previous analysis that we used to find rows that have no signal, and instead use it to find the rows that have our signals. There are 4 rows of signals. The first three have all 12 leads, and the bottom row is lead II going all the way across to be used for rate and rhythm.\n\nbands_of_signal &lt;- high_value_rows |&gt;\n  filter(count &lt; max(count)) |&gt;\n  mutate(next_row = lead(row)) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(next_row)) |&gt;\n  mutate(band = row - next_row == 1) |&gt;\n  group_by(temp = cumsum(!lag(band, default = TRUE))) |&gt;\n  mutate(band = cur_group_id()) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  select(-temp) |&gt;\n  group_by(band) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    start = min(row),\n    end = max(row),\n    zero_volatage = row[which.min(count)])\n\n\nbands_of_signal_graph &lt;- ggplot(bands_of_signal |&gt; filter(band &gt;= 5 & band &lt;= 8) |&gt; mutate(band = as.factor(band)), aes(labels = band, xmin = start, xmax = end, ymin = 0, ymax = 2200)) +\n    annotation_raster(red, xmin = 0, xmax = 1700, ymin = 0, ymax = 2200) +\n    geom_rect(aes(fill = band), alpha = 0.5) +\n    geom_vline(aes(xintercept = zero_volatage), color = \"red\") +\n    coord_flip() +\n    ylim(c(0, 2200)) +\n    xlim(c(0, 1700))\n\n\n\nbands_of_signal_graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we’ve found the parts of the image that have signal and we also identified the zero voltage line. Technically, zero voltage is defined as the voltage between the T wave and the following P wave, but this approximation of counting dark pixels in each row and identifying a local maximum seems to work incredibly well. You’ll notice that the bands are labeled 5-8 because I started at the top and each section of text or signal created a band. This will not always be consistent. In lead II, you can see that the label is a new band, but in the other rows, the label is included in the band. Depending on the patient, the device, and the strength of the lead connection, the amplitude of the signal can vary and overlap with the label (sometimes even overlap with the signal above or below).\n\n\nTracing the signal\nLet’s see if we can trace the signal on the red channel. The naive approach is to find the location of the min value in each column, and when there is more than one, take the highest location. I’ll also block out where the letters are so we can avoid those.\n\nleads &lt;- lapply(seq(5,8), function(x) {\nband &lt;- red_matrix[(1700 - bands_of_signal$end[x]):(1700 - bands_of_signal$start[x]),,1]\nif(x != 8) {\n  band[length(band[,1]):(length(band[,1])-42), 100:150] &lt;- 255\n  band[length(band[,1]):(length(band[,1])-42), 600:675] &lt;- 255\n  band[length(band[,1]):(length(band[,1])-42), 1090:1150] &lt;- 255\n  band[length(band[,1]):(length(band[,1])-42), 1590:1650] &lt;- 255\n}\nband_tibble &lt;- tibble(\n  column = seq(1, 2200)) |&gt;\nmutate(row = map_int(column, function(y) bands_of_signal$end[x] - min(which(band[,y] == min(band[,y]))))) |&gt;\nmutate(band = x)\n    }) |&gt;\n    bind_rows()\n\n\nbands_graph &lt;- ggplot(leads, aes(x = column, y = row, color = as.factor(band))) +\n  annotation_raster(red, xmin = 0, xmax = 2200, ymin = 0, ymax = 1700) +\n  geom_line() +\n  xlim(c(0, 2200)) +\n  ylim(c(0, 1700)) +\n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Band\")\n\n\nbands_graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConverting to time series\nNow that we have our signal traced, converting it to a time series is easy. We just need to subtract the zero voltage and convert the x and y coordinates into ms and mV, respectively.\n\nleads_time_series &lt;- leads |&gt;\n  left_join(bands_of_signal, by = \"band\") |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    mV = (row - zero_volatage)/big_box_width * 0.5,\n    ms = column/big_box_width * 200)\n\n\n  lead_time_series_plot &lt;- ggplot(leads_time_series, aes(x = ms, y = mV)) +\n    geom_line() +\n    facet_grid(rows = vars(band))\n\n  lead_time_series_plot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow our EKG is 10 seconds long. We could probably take it further by breaking it down into each individual lead and trimming the false signal along the edges, but I think we’ve demonstrated how we can get this done with image processing and some basic knowledge about EKGs.\nThat said, there is definitely opportunity to improve this process with machine learning. We used a pretty standard PNG. The competition also includes paper scans, pictures taken with cell phones, black and white scans, etc. A robust process would be to use machine learning to get the EKG oriented correctly, colorize it into something consistent, and mark regions where the signal is and isn’t (e.g. making sure the aVR label doesn’t get interpreted as signal).\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nKuhn, Markus, Stannered, and MoodyGroove. 2007.

This makes it really easy to edit because you can focus on the content and not have to worry about spacing, making sure arrows are straight, or selecting groups of objects to move down in order to make room for something in the middle. It also means that you can describe your process to ChatGPT or other AI tool of choice and it’ll give you a pretty good start that you can just copy and paste into a markdown document.\nTo demonstrate both the power of mermaid.js and how you can prepare a potluck-less Friendsgiving, I’ve diagrammed my process below and also included some reference recipes for the various dishes.\n\ngantt\n\n  title Thanksgiving Prep - Before Thanksgiving\n  dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm\n  axisFormat %d-%H:%M\n  \n  section Turkey\n    Buy frozen turkey :milestone, 2025-11-18 14:30, 0d \n    Thaw turkey: t2, 2025-11-20 14:30, 4d\n    Dry brine: t4, 2025-11-24 14:30, 2d\n\n  section Cheesecake\n    Take cream cheese out of fridge :milestone, 2025-11-25 17:15, 0d \n    Crust: t15, 2025-11-26 18:00, 15m \n    Filling: t15a, 2025-11-26 18:15, 20m\n    Bake: t16, 2025-11-26 18:35, 75m\n\n\n\n\ngantt\n\n  title Thanksgiving Prep - Before Thanksgiving\n  dateFormat YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm\n  axisFormat %d-%H:%M\n  \n  section Turkey\n    Buy frozen turkey :milestone, 2025-11-18 14:30, 0d \n    Thaw turkey: t2, 2025-11-20 14:30, 4d\n    Dry brine: t4, 2025-11-24 14:30, 2d\n\n  section Cheesecake\n    Take cream cheese out of fridge :milestone, 2025-11-25 17:15, 0d \n    Crust: t15, 2025-11-26 18:00, 15m \n    Filling: t15a, 2025-11-26 18:15, 20m\n    Bake: t16, 2025-11-26 18:35, 75m \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngantt\n  title Thanksgiving - Day of\n  dateFormat HH:mm\n  axisFormat %H:%M\n  \n  section Turkey\n    Apply rub: t5, 2025-11-27 10:00, 30m\n    Smoke Turkey: t7, 2025-11-27 12:00, 4.5h\n    Rest Turkey: t8, 2025-11-27 16:30, 1.5h\n\n  section Mac and cheese\n    Prep sauce: 2025-11-27 16:15, 30m\n    Cook pasta: 2025-11-27 16:45, 10m\n    Assemble and add panko: 2025-11-27 16:55, 5m\n    smoke mac and cheese: 2025-11-27 17:00, 1h\n  \n  section Baked Brie\n    Prep Baked Brie: t13, 2025-11-27 17:00, 10m\n    Bake Baked Brie: t14, 2025-11-27 17:30, 25m\n\n  section Green Bean Casserole\n    Thaw green beans: t17c, 2025-11-27 08:00, 1h\n    Prepare Roux: t17a, 2025-11-27 10:00, 20m\n    Mix in green beans: t17b, 2025-11-27 10:20, 7m\n    Add French's Onions: 2025-11-27 17:10, 5m\n    Bake Casserole: t18, 2025-11-27 17:15, 45m\n\n  section Mashed Potatoes\n    Chop Potatoes: 2025-11-27 16:55, 15m\n    Boil Potatoes: 2025-11-27 17:10, 40m\n    Mash Potatoes: 2025-11-27 17:50, 10m\n\n  section Sweet Potatoes\n    Chop Potatoes: 2025-11-27 16:15, 15m\n    Boil Potatoes: 2025-11-27 16:30, 40m\n    Mash Potatoes: 2025-11-27 17:10, 10m\n    Prepare Casserole: 2025-11-27 17:20, 10m\n    Bake Casserole: 2025-11-27 17:30, 30m\n\n  section Stuffing\n    Chop and toast bread: 2025-11-27 10:30, 30m\n    Saute vegetables: 2025-11-27 14:00, 30m\n    Combine stock mixture, bread, and vegetables: 2025-11-27 17:00, 30m\n    Bake Stuffing: 2025-11-27 17:30, 30m\n\n  section Cranberry Sauce\n    Simmer cranberries, sugar, and spices: 2025-11-27 16:00, 30m\n    Cool: 2025-11-27 16:30, 1.5h\n\n\n\n\ngantt\n  title Thanksgiving - Day of\n  dateFormat HH:mm\n  axisFormat %H:%M\n  \n  section Turkey\n    Apply rub: t5, 2025-11-27 10:00, 30m\n    Smoke Turkey: t7, 2025-11-27 12:00, 4.5h\n    Rest Turkey: t8, 2025-11-27 16:30, 1.5h\n\n  section Mac and cheese\n    Prep sauce: 2025-11-27 16:15, 30m\n    Cook pasta: 2025-11-27 16:45, 10m\n    Assemble and add panko: 2025-11-27 16:55, 5m\n    smoke mac and cheese: 2025-11-27 17:00, 1h\n  \n  section Baked Brie\n    Prep Baked Brie: t13, 2025-11-27 17:00, 10m\n    Bake Baked Brie: t14, 2025-11-27 17:30, 25m\n\n  section Green Bean Casserole\n    Thaw green beans: t17c, 2025-11-27 08:00, 1h\n    Prepare Roux: t17a, 2025-11-27 10:00, 20m\n    Mix in green beans: t17b, 2025-11-27 10:20, 7m\n    Add French's Onions: 2025-11-27 17:10, 5m\n    Bake Casserole: t18, 2025-11-27 17:15, 45m\n\n  section Mashed Potatoes\n    Chop Potatoes: 2025-11-27 16:55, 15m\n    Boil Potatoes: 2025-11-27 17:10, 40m\n    Mash Potatoes: 2025-11-27 17:50, 10m\n\n  section Sweet Potatoes\n    Chop Potatoes: 2025-11-27 16:15, 15m\n    Boil Potatoes: 2025-11-27 16:30, 40m\n    Mash Potatoes: 2025-11-27 17:10, 10m\n    Prepare Casserole: 2025-11-27 17:20, 10m\n    Bake Casserole: 2025-11-27 17:30, 30m\n\n  section Stuffing\n    Chop and toast bread: 2025-11-27 10:30, 30m\n    Saute vegetables: 2025-11-27 14:00, 30m\n    Combine stock mixture, bread, and vegetables: 2025-11-27 17:00, 30m\n    Bake Stuffing: 2025-11-27 17:30, 30m\n\n  section Cranberry Sauce\n    Simmer cranberries, sugar, and spices: 2025-11-27 16:00, 30m\n    Cool: 2025-11-27 16:30, 1.5h\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant Notes\nIf you can find a refrigerated (not frozen), air-chilled turkey, go for that one. Antibiotic-free doesn’t mean anything, at least in the US, federal law requires all poultry to be antibiotic-free. Fancy heirloom turkeys are nice, but not $12/lb nice. If you hosting a Friendsgiving earlier in November, don’t wait until the last minute thinking you can find a refrigerated turkey unless you’ve already identified and confirmed a source. They are definitely harder to find and the speed-thawing process for frozen turkey is painful.\nWatch this video before smoking your turkey. Aaron Franklin is truly a scholar in the world of smoked foods.\nI adapted the smoked mac and cheese recipe from here. I very rarely have leftovers.\nOther recipes:\n\nGreen Bean Casserole\nStuffing\n\nFor everything else, I mostly just winged it. Apply heat to the ingredients, and mix in some reasonable spices.\nImportantly, I smoked my turkey which I believe is the superior cooking method. A major stressor in Thanksgiving is that usually when the turkey is in the oven, nothing else can go in. Moving the turkey to an alternative cooking space (second oven, smoker, sous vide) makes things a lot easier.\nI hope this is helpful! Feel free to adapt this diagram for your plan and let me know how it goes!"

    "title": "From the Furrows - building a grownup backend",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Over a year ago, I committed my first lines of code for our new app. At that point I had used R for advanced data analysis work and dabbled into building my first applications. Armed with that and some product knowledge building health apps. Peter and I started on our Harvvest journey. We started assembling a list of brands with affiliate links and I created my first endpoint using plumber to show that list to the client.\nNow our app has become more complex. Users can preview brand deals to promote, generate their unique links, receive brand kits for the deals they want to promote, and track and withdraw their earnings. We brought on a more experienced backend developer and have started building the next version of our app, informed by the challenges from the previous year. One of the particularly interesting things about this type of growth is that some of the decisions that we are now considering suboptimal were actually pretty good for when we were getting started. And some of them were just bad. I’m going to go through some of those considerations here. \n\n\n\nPeter and I over a year into Harvvest with our first company swag\n\n\n\nWriting a backend in R\nThere is a lot of commentary for and against R in production environments. This article provides an excellent technical discussion on the topic. For an application like Harvvest, languages more tailored towards performance and concurrency rather than statistics would have been better. That said, it was the language I knew best. And because I had that knowledge, I could focus more on the programming methodology rather than banging my head against tons of syntax errors and blindly copying code for ChatGPT or StackOverflow. In fact, as we are transitioning to Python and FastAPI, we’re finding that probably around 85% of the endpoints and general functionality will be conserved. Also, I was able to build faster. When we planned for a new feature, I would typically have the backend and documentation completed within a day. Overall, I was happy with this choice in the beginning, and I think we still could have gotten more mileage from our R backend.\nI did do a couple of important changes along the way to account for some of R’s shortcomings. The first was that for some functionality, like sending a welcome email, it made sense to do it with a database function instead of via the backend. Accounts were created through direct interface with Supabase, so the database would know before the backend knew that an account had been created. Another change was that I moved functionality related to followers to a separate service written in Elixir. Our app would primarily be used by influencers. Their followers, who probably outnumber influencers by at least an order of magnitude, interact with the links that the influencers generate and post. With that change, our linking service was able to support our highest traffic days.\n\n\nDatabases\nMy background with databases until this point had been almost entirely querying data with SQL and working with it in R. I had never created tables or stored data in a database before. We made the decision to use Google Cloud because I had burned through my AWS free trials on a previous project. The natural option then became Firebase’s NoSQL database. Not only was I not familiar with interfacing with these types of databases, but I also could not find a mature R package to abstract the nuances away. I got to the point where I was using httr2 to populate brand deals into the Firebase before deciding that this process was not sustainable and I need to switch to something I was more familiar with–Postgres.\nI ended up choosing Supabase without really understanding all the implications of that decision. Fortunately, it had benefits that I did not realize as I was making the decision. User creation and authentication are automatically taken care of, social logins were much easier to implement, and security was largely handled for me. Additionally, their free tier is plenty to prove out an idea.\nAn important lesson I learned is that using R to interface with a database for data analysis and data science vs building a consumer application. Querying data using dbplyr is fantastic, but R does a lot of magic behind the scenes in the form of type changing. Enums and uuids both get changed to strings. And you don’t need to do anything with foreign keys to link your tables together–you just know which columns you want to join by and join them. This resulted in the schema visualizer showing each table in a vertical line with no relationships between them. It also was incorrectly forgiving when saving values that had inconsistent capitalization or other subtle differences.\n\n\nCI/CD\nFor some of my earlier projects, my deployments involved building a docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, then SSHing into my ec2 instance on AWS, and then pulling and running the container. For Harvvest, we switched to GCP and I used Cloud Run and Cloud Build. Both of these made it very easy for me to build and deploy just by merging a pull request on Github. I had encountered a few cases where my local testing using docker compose would behave differently than the cloud deployment. Sometimes it was related to resources available to the container. Several times, I forgot to add new environment variables. One of the most frustrating was that Cloud Run had a harder time executing a complex initial command, such as importing my libraries and starting Plumber. For that I created an init.R file with all the setup commands an then used a simple Rscript init.R in my Dockerfile.\nWith my setup, building and deploying from Github was the only thing I knew how to do. A downside to this was that I was building separate containers for dev and production. For our new pipeline we are going to switch to only building the dev app, and then re-deploying that image in production when testing is complete. Additionally, we have done very little with testing via Github actions and are planning to incorporate more of that to help us feel more confident in our releases."

    "text": "TidyTuesday is a weekly data visualization challenge. The details for this week can be found here.\n\nIntroduction\nThis week we’re looking at edible plants. I’m interested in understanding the relationship between sun and water requirements and the caloric content of the plant. Generally I would expect that if a plant needs more energy from the sun, it’s because it is storing more sugars in it’s fruit.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nI use the tidytuesdayR package to load the data the first time. Then I store it locally in a csv.\n\nedible_plants &lt;- tidytuesdayR::tt_load(\"2026-02-03\")[[1]]\nwrite_csv(edible_plants, \"edible_plants.csv\")\n\n\nedible_plants &lt;- read_csv(\"edible_plants.csv\", show_col_types = FALSE) |&gt;\n  mutate(sunlight = tolower(sunlight) |&gt; str_replace_all(\"/ \", \"/\") |&gt; factor())\n\nedible_plants$water &lt;- factor(edible_plants$water, levels= c(\"Very Low\", \"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\", \"Very High\"))\n\n\n\nExploring columns of interest\nLet’s look at the values in the sunlight, water, and energy columns.\n\nedible_plants |&gt;\n  select(sunlight, water, energy, nutrients) |&gt;\n  glimpse()\n\nRows: 140\nColumns: 4\n$ sunlight  &lt;fct&gt; full sun, full sun, full sun, full sun/partial shade/full sh…\n$ water     &lt;fct&gt; Very High, Medium, Medium, Very Low, High, Medium, Medium, M…\n$ energy    &lt;dbl&gt; 80, 27, 27, 88, 25, 34, 35, 31, 50, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, …\n$ nutrients &lt;chr&gt; \"Medium\", \"Medium\", \"Medium\", \"Medium\", \"High\", \"High\", \"Hig…\n\n\nIt looks like there are a lot of NA values for energy, but we can probably use nutrients as a another output measurement. Also our inputs are going to be factors not numbers. This will impact the types of analyses we can use.\nLet’s start with a basic visualization for the non-NA energy content plants.\n\nedible_plants |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(energy)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = water, y = energy)) +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(sunlight)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_light()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCouple notable things here:\n\nIt looks the ability to tolerate shade is correlated with a lower caloric content.\nA surprising outlier, broad beans, or fava beans, can grow in full shade, with low water, and have the highest caloric content.\n\nIf we had more energy values, we could formalize our observations with a two-way ANOVA.\nInstead, let’s look at the nutrients dependent variable. Because this is categorical as well, we’ll use an ordinal logistic regression. It’s important to note that nutrients isn’t a replacement for the energy variable. It describes the nutrient needs for the plant to grow. So a reasonable hypothesis is that if you have plenty of sun and water, you can don’t need to rely on extra nutrients in the soil.\n\nedible_plants &lt;- edible_plants |&gt;\n  filter(nutrients %in% c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"))\nedible_plants$nutrients &lt;- factor(edible_plants$nutrients, levels = c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\"))\nm &lt;-MASS::polr(nutrients ~ sunlight + water, data = edible_plants, Hess = TRUE)\nsummary(m)\n\nCall:\nMASS::polr(formula = nutrients ~ sunlight + water, data = edible_plants, \n    Hess = TRUE)\n\nCoefficients:\n                                             Value Std.

What we see here is the opposite. The ability to tolerate full shade suggests a lower nutrient requirement. Similarly any amount of water beyond “Very Low” suggests a lower nutrient requirement. Maybe the better way to think about it is that sunlight or derivative sugar molecules are used with the nutrients in biochemical reactions.\nWe can represent this visually here:\n\nedible_plants |&gt;\n  filter(nutrients %in% c(\"Low\", \"Medium\", \"High\")) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(water)) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = nutrients)) +\n  facet_grid(rows = vars(sunlight), cols = vars(water)) +\n  geom_bar() +\n  theme_light() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))"
