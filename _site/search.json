    "section": "",
    "text": "Over a year ago, I committed my first lines of code for our new app. At that point I had used R for advanced data analysis work and dabbled into building my first applications. Armed with that and some product knowledge building health apps. Peter and I started on our Harvvest journey. We started assembling a list of brands with affiliate links and I created my first endpoint using plumber to show that list to the client.\nNow our app has become more complex. Users can preview brand deals to promote, generate their unique links, receive brand kits for the deals they want to promote, and track and withdraw their earnings. We brought on a more experienced backend developer and have started building the next version of our app, informed by the challenges from the previous year. One of the particularly interesting things about this type of growth is that some of the decisions that we are now considering suboptimal were actually pretty good for when we were getting started. And some of them were just bad. I’m going to go through some of those considerations here. \n\n\n\nPeter and I over a year into Harvvest with our first company swag\n\n\n\nWriting a backend in R\nThere is a lot of commentary for and against R in production environments. This article provides an excellent technical discussion on the topic. For an application like Harvvest, languages more tailored towards performance and concurrency rather than statistics would have been better. That said, it was the language I knew best. And because I had that knowledge, I could focus more on the programming methodology rather than banging my head against tons of syntax errors and blindly copying code for ChatGPT or StackOverflow. In fact, as we are transitioning to Python and FastAPI, we’re finding that probably around 85% of the endpoints and general functionality will be conserved. Also, I was able to build faster. When we planned for a new feature, I would typically have the backend and documentation completed within a day. Overall, I was happy with this choice in the beginning, and I think we still could have gotten more mileage from our R backend.\nI did do a couple of important changes along the way to account for some of R’s shortcomings. The first was that for some functionality, like sending a welcome email, it made sense to do it with a database function instead of via the backend. Accounts were created through direct interface with Supabase, so the database would know before the backend knew that an account had been created. Another change was that I moved functionality related to followers to a separate service written in Elixir. Our app would primarily be used by influencers. Their followers, who probably outnumber influencers by at least an order of magnitude, interact with the links that the influencers generate and post. With that change, our linking service was able to support our highest traffic days.\n\n\nDatabases\nMy background with databases until this point had been almost entirely querying data with SQL and working with it in R. I had never created tables or stored data in a database before. We made the decision to use Google Cloud because I had burned through my AWS free trials on a previous project. The natural option then became Firebase’s NoSQL database. Not only was I not familiar with interfacing with these types of databases, but I also could not find a mature R package to abstract the nuances away. I got to the point where I was using httr2 to populate brand deals into the Firebase before deciding that this process was not sustainable and I need to switch to something I was more familiar with–Postgres.\nI ended up choosing Supabase without really understanding all the implications of that decision. Fortunately, it had benefits that I did not realize as I was making the decision. User creation and authentication are automatically taken care of, social logins were much easier to implement, and security was largely handled for me. Additionally, their free tier is plenty to prove out an idea.\nAn important lesson I learned is that using R to interface with a database for data analysis and data science vs building a consumer application. Querying data using dbplyr is fantastic, but R does a lot of magic behind the scenes in the form of type changing. Enums and uuids both get changed to strings. And you don’t need to do anything with foreign keys to link your tables together–you just know which columns you want to join by and join them. This resulted in the schema visualizer showing each table in a vertical line with no relationships between them. It also was incorrectly forgiving when saving values that had inconsistent capitalization or other subtle differences.\n\n\nCI/CD\nFor some of my earlier projects, my deployments involved building a docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, then SSHing into my ec2 instance on AWS, and then pulling and running the container. For Harvvest, we switched to GCP and I used Cloud Run and Cloud Build. Both of these made it very easy for me to build and deploy just by merging a pull request on Github. I had encountered a few cases where my local testing using docker compose would behave differently than the cloud deployment. Sometimes it was related to resources available to the container. Several times, I forgot to add new environment variables. One of the most frustrating was that Cloud Run had a harder time executing a complex initial command, such as importing my libraries and starting Plumber. For that I created an init.R file with all the setup commands an then used a simple Rscript init.R in my Dockerfile.\nWith my setup, building and deploying from Github was the only thing I knew how to do. A downside to this was that I was building separate containers for dev and production. For our new pipeline we are going to switch to only building the dev app, and then re-deploying that image in production when testing is complete. Additionally, we have done very little with testing via Github actions and are planning to incorporate more of that to help us feel more confident in our releases."

Stangerson was a quiet\n2026\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\n2027\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night\n2028\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nof his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed,\n2029\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nafter twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be\n2030\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free\n2031\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nand familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude\n2032\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ntowards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way\n2033\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwhich, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand.

When I closed\n2055\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas,\n2056\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nin less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that\n2057\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nMr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the\n2058\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nworse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting\n2059\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwith my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed\n2060\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhis train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed\n2061\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto her that she should fly with him. \"You are of age,\" he said, \"and\n2062\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never\n2063\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nmind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You\n2064\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshall live like a princess.\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she\n2065\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured\n2066\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son\n2067\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nArthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard\n2068\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to\n2069\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nraise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the\n2070\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ndoorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \"I don't think that fine\n2071\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nfellow will trouble us again,\" he said. \"I will just go after him and\n2072\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsee what he does with himself.\" With those words he took his hat and\n2073\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nstarted off down the street.

At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the\n2078\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwords. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that\n2079\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere should be no possibility of a mistake.\"\n2080\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2081\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"It's quite exciting,\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \"What\n2082\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhappened next?\"\n2083\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2084\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\" the detective continued, \"I saw that\n2085\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe whole case hung upon one point.

The lines can be concatenated so that each observation is a paragraph. This will be particularly useful in understanding dialog because it is typical in literature to start a new paragraph each time a speaker changes. The NAs between lines mean we have a good boundary between paragraphs.\nAdditionally, I cross-referenced the novel order with the Canon of Sherlock Holmes in order to understand the order in which these works were published.

Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?\"\n\n\n7456\n\"There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to reason. You see my point?\"\n\n\n7457\nHolmes sprang from his chair.\n\n\n7458\n\"Get behind him, Watson! Don't let him out! Now, sir, let us see the contents of that note-book.\"\n\n\n7459\nMilverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and stood with his back against the wall.\n\n\n7460\n\"Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,\" he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. \"I have been expecting you to do something original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mistaken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.\" He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.\n\n\n7461\nHolmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. \"I'll be back some time, Watson,\" said he, and vanished into the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take.\n\n\n7462\nFor some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion.\n\n\n7463\n\"You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?\"\n\n\n7464\n\"No, indeed!\"\n\n\n7465\n\"You'll be interested to hear that I am engaged.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nF.

The Foreign Minister alone I could have withstood, but when the Premier also deigned to visit my humble roof--! The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people. He was in a class by himself. Things were going wrong, and no one could understand why they were going wrong. Agents were suspected or even caught, but there was evidence of some strong and secret central force. It was absolutely necessary to expose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter. It has cost me two years, Watson, but they have not been devoid of excitement. When I say that I started my pilgrimage at Chicago, graduated in an Irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man, you will realize that the matter was complex. Since then I have been honoured by his confidence, which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison.

My God! to better myself! My wife and three children came with me. I started a dry goods store on Market Square, and I prospered well. The word had gone round that I was a Freeman, and I was forced to join the local lodge, same as you did last night. I've the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my heart. I found that I was under the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime. What could I do? Every word I said to make things better was taken as treason, same as it was last night.

A few years ago I read Nabokov’s favorite word is mauve by Ben Blatt. The methods for quantifying literature are both interesting and compelling, and I’m interested in seeing if there are similar patterns here. Sidenote: that book was described to me as “the most NPR book ever,” and I love that.\nMy first step is to explore samples of the data to see if it’s usable as is.\n\nbooks &lt;- data |&gt;\n  distinct(book) |&gt;\n  mutate(publish_order = row_number())\n\n\n\ntext_sample &lt;- data[2000:2100,]\n\ntext_sample |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Text\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Text\n\n\nbook\ntext\nline_num\n\n\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'You had best tell me all about it now,' I said.

Do not imagine that my agitation on\n2005\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nbehalf of my son arises from any fear lest he should have had a hand\n2006\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nin this terrible affair. He is utterly innocent of it. My dread is,\n2007\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhowever, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he may appear to\n2008\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nbe compromised. That however is surely impossible. His high\n2009\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ncharacter, his profession, his antecedents would all forbid it.'\n2010\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2011\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered.\n2012\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n'Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he will be none the worse.'\n2013\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2014\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she said, and\n2015\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nher daughter withdrew. 'Now, sir,' she continued, 'I had no intention\n2016\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nof telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it\n2017\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nI have no alternative. Having once decided to speak, I will tell you\n2018\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nall without omitting any particular.'\n2019\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2020\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'It is your wisest course,' said I.\n2021\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2022\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He and his\n2023\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\n2024\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nnoticed a \"Copenhagen\" label upon each of their trunks, showing that\n2025\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\n2026\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\n2027\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night\n2028\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nof his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed,\n2029\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nafter twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be\n2030\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free\n2031\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nand familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude\n2032\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ntowards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way\n2033\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwhich, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one\n2034\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noccasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her--an\n2035\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noutrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his\n2036\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nunmanly conduct.'\n2037\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2038\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked. 'I suppose that you can\n2039\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nget rid of your boarders when you wish.'\n2040\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2041\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. 'Would to God\n2042\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthat I had given him notice on the very day that he came,' she said.\n2043\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n'But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day\n2044\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\neach--fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season. I am a\n2045\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwidow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the\n2046\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nmoney. I acted for the best. This last was too much, however, and I\n2047\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ngave him notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his\n2048\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ngoing.'\n2049\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2050\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Well?'\n2051\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2052\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'My heart grew light when I saw him drive away. My son is on leave\n2053\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\njust now, but I did not tell him anything of all this, for his temper\n2054\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nis violent, and he is passionately fond of his sister. When I closed\n2055\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas,\n2056\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nin less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that\n2057\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nMr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the\n2058\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nworse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting\n2059\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwith my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed\n2060\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhis train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed\n2061\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto her that she should fly with him. \"You are of age,\" he said, \"and\n2062\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never\n2063\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nmind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You\n2064\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshall live like a princess.\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she\n2065\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured\n2066\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son\n2067\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nArthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard\n2068\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to\n2069\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nraise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the\n2070\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ndoorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \"I don't think that fine\n2071\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nfellow will trouble us again,\" he said. \"I will just go after him and\n2072\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsee what he does with himself.\" With those words he took his hat and\n2073\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nstarted off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr.\n2074\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nDrebber's mysterious death.'\n2075\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2076\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and\n2077\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the\n2078\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwords. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that\n2079\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere should be no possibility of a mistake.\"\n2080\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2081\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"It's quite exciting,\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \"What\n2082\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhappened next?\"\n2083\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2084\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\" the detective continued, \"I saw that\n2085\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe whole case hung upon one point. Fixing her with my eye in a way\n2086\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwhich I always found effective with women, I asked her at what hour\n2087\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nher son returned.\n2088\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2089\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'I do not know,' she answered.\n2090\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2091\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Not know?'\n2092\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2093\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'No; he has a latch-key, and he let himself in.'\n2094\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2095\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'After you went to bed?'\n2096\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2097\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'Yes.'\n2098\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2099\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'When did you go to bed?'\n2100\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most remarkable thing from the sample is that each observation represents a literal line in the novel. The lines can be concatenated so that each observation is a paragraph. This will be particularly useful in understanding dialog because it is typical in literature to start a new paragraph each time a speaker changes. The NAs between lines mean we have a good boundary between paragraphs.\nAdditionally, I cross-referenced the novel order with the Canon of Sherlock Holmes in order to understand the order in which these works were published. I think it could be interesting to see if there are changes that occur between earlier works and later works.\n\nparagraphs &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(paragraph = cumsum(is.na(text))) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(text)) |&gt;\n  group_by(book,paragraph) |&gt;\n  summarize(text = paste(text, collapse = \" \"))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'book'.

Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?\"\n\n\n7456\n\"There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to reason. You see my point?\"\n\n\n7457\nHolmes sprang from his chair.\n\n\n7458\n\"Get behind him, Watson! Don't let him out! Now, sir, let us see the contents of that note-book.\"\n\n\n7459\nMilverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and stood with his back against the wall.\n\n\n7460\n\"Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,\" he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. \"I have been expecting you to do something original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mistaken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.\" He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.\n\n\n7461\nHolmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. \"I'll be back some time, Watson,\" said he, and vanished into the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take.\n\n\n7462\nFor some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing.

The Foreign Minister alone I could have withstood, but when the Premier also deigned to visit my humble roof--! The fact is, Watson, that this gentleman upon the sofa was a bit too good for our people. He was in a class by himself. Things were going wrong, and no one could understand why they were going wrong. Agents were suspected or even caught, but there was evidence of some strong and secret central force. It was absolutely necessary to expose it. Strong pressure was brought upon me to look into the matter. It has cost me two years, Watson, but they have not been devoid of excitement. When I say that I started my pilgrimage at Chicago, graduated in an Irish secret society at Buffalo, gave serious trouble to the constabulary at Skibbareen, and so eventually caught the eye of a subordinate agent of Von Bork, who recommended me as a likely man, you will realize that the matter was complex. Since then I have been honoured by his confidence, which has not prevented most of his plans going subtly wrong and five of his best agents being in prison. I watched them, Watson, and I picked them as they ripened. Well, sir, I hope that you are none the worse!\"\n2\n\n\nThe Valley Of Fear\n10874\n\"Impossible!\"\n1\n\n\nThe Valley Of Fear\n11415\n\"Nor did I when I joined it at Philadelphia. It was just a benefit club and a meeting place for one's fellows. Then I heard of this place--curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears!--and I came to better myself! My God! to better myself! My wife and three children came with me. I started a dry goods store on Market Square, and I prospered well. The word had gone round that I was a Freeman, and I was forced to join the local lodge, same as you did last night. I've the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on my heart. I found that I was under the orders of a black villain and caught in a meshwork of crime. What could I do? Every word I said to make things better was taken as treason, same as it was last night. I can't get away; for all I have in the world is in my store. If I leave the society, I know well that it means murder to me, and God knows what to my wife and children. Oh, man, it is awful--awful!\" He put his hands to his face, and his body shook with convulsive sobs.\n5\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Golden Pince-Nez\n8047\n\"Here!
