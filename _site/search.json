    "section": "",
    "text": "Over a year ago, I committed my first lines of code for our new app. At that point I had used R for advanced data analysis work and dabbled into building my first applications. Armed with that and some product knowledge building health apps. Peter and I started on our Harvvest journey. We started assembling a list of brands with affiliate links and I created my first endpoint using plumber to show that list to the client.\nNow our app has become more complex. Users can preview brand deals to promote, generate their unique links, receive brand kits for the deals they want to promote, and track and withdraw their earnings. We brought on a more experienced backend developer and have started building the next version of our app, informed by the challenges from the previous year. One of the particularly interesting things about this type of growth is that some of the decisions that we are now considering suboptimal were actually pretty good for when we were getting started. And some of them were just bad. I’m going to go through some of those considerations here. \n\n\n\nPeter and I over a year into Harvvest with our first company swag\n\n\n\nWriting a backend in R\nThere is a lot of commentary for and against R in production environments. This article provides an excellent technical discussion on the topic. For an application like Harvvest, languages more tailored towards performance and concurrency rather than statistics would have been better. That said, it was the language I knew best. And because I had that knowledge, I could focus more on the programming methodology rather than banging my head against tons of syntax errors and blindly copying code for ChatGPT or StackOverflow. In fact, as we are transitioning to Python and FastAPI, we’re finding that probably around 85% of the endpoints and general functionality will be conserved. Also, I was able to build faster. When we planned for a new feature, I would typically have the backend and documentation completed within a day. Overall, I was happy with this choice in the beginning, and I think we still could have gotten more mileage from our R backend.\nI did do a couple of important changes along the way to account for some of R’s shortcomings. The first was that for some functionality, like sending a welcome email, it made sense to do it with a database function instead of via the backend. Accounts were created through direct interface with Supabase, so the database would know before the backend knew that an account had been created. Another change was that I moved functionality related to followers to a separate service written in Elixir. Our app would primarily be used by influencers. Their followers, who probably outnumber influencers by at least an order of magnitude, interact with the links that the influencers generate and post. With that change, our linking service was able to support our highest traffic days.\n\n\nDatabases\nMy background with databases until this point had been almost entirely querying data with SQL and working with it in R. I had never created tables or stored data in a database before. We made the decision to use Google Cloud because I had burned through my AWS free trials on a previous project. The natural option then became Firebase’s NoSQL database. Not only was I not familiar with interfacing with these types of databases, but I also could not find a mature R package to abstract the nuances away. I got to the point where I was using httr2 to populate brand deals into the Firebase before deciding that this process was not sustainable and I need to switch to something I was more familiar with–Postgres.\nI ended up choosing Supabase without really understanding all the implications of that decision. Fortunately, it had benefits that I did not realize as I was making the decision. User creation and authentication are automatically taken care of, social logins were much easier to implement, and security was largely handled for me. Additionally, their free tier is plenty to prove out an idea.\nAn important lesson I learned is that using R to interface with a database for data analysis and data science vs building a consumer application. Querying data using dbplyr is fantastic, but R does a lot of magic behind the scenes in the form of type changing. Enums and uuids both get changed to strings. And you don’t need to do anything with foreign keys to link your tables together–you just know which columns you want to join by and join them. This resulted in the schema visualizer showing each table in a vertical line with no relationships between them. It also was incorrectly forgiving when saving values that had inconsistent capitalization or other subtle differences.\n\n\nCI/CD\nFor some of my earlier projects, my deployments involved building a docker image, pushing it to Docker Hub, then SSHing into my ec2 instance on AWS, and then pulling and running the container. For Harvvest, we switched to GCP and I used Cloud Run and Cloud Build. Both of these made it very easy for me to build and deploy just by merging a pull request on Github. I had encountered a few cases where my local testing using docker compose would behave differently than the cloud deployment. Sometimes it was related to resources available to the container. Several times, I forgot to add new environment variables. One of the most frustrating was that Cloud Run had a harder time executing a complex initial command, such as importing my libraries and starting Plumber. For that I created an init.R file with all the setup commands an then used a simple Rscript init.R in my Dockerfile.\nWith my setup, building and deploying from Github was the only thing I knew how to do. A downside to this was that I was building separate containers for dev and production. For our new pipeline we are going to switch to only building the dev app, and then re-deploying that image in production when testing is complete. Additionally, we have done very little with testing via Github actions and are planning to incorporate more of that to help us feel more confident in our releases."

Stangerson was a quiet\n2026\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\n2027\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night\n2028\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nof his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed,\n2029\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nafter twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be\n2030\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsober. His manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free\n2031\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nand familiar. Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude\n2032\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ntowards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way\n2033\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwhich, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one\n2034\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noccasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her--an\n2035\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noutrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his\n2036\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nunmanly conduct.'\n2037\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2038\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked.

When I closed\n2055\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas,\n2056\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nin less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that\n2057\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nMr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the\n2058\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nworse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting\n2059\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwith my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed\n2060\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhis train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed\n2061\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto her that she should fly with him. \"You are of age,\" he said, \"and\n2062\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never\n2063\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nmind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You\n2064\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshall live like a princess.\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she\n2065\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured\n2066\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son\n2067\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nArthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard\n2068\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to\n2069\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nraise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the\n2070\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ndoorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \"I don't think that fine\n2071\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nfellow will trouble us again,\" he said. \"I will just go after him and\n2072\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsee what he does with himself.\" With those words he took his hat and\n2073\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nstarted off down the street.

At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the\n2078\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwords. I made shorthand notes of all that she said, however, so that\n2079\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere should be no possibility of a mistake.\"\n2080\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2081\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"It's quite exciting,\" said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. \"What\n2082\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhappened next?\"\n2083\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2084\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"When Mrs. Charpentier paused,\" the detective continued, \"I saw that\n2085\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe whole case hung upon one point.

The lines can be concatenated so that each observation is a paragraph. This will be particularly useful in understanding dialog because it is typical in literature to start a new paragraph each time a speaker changes. The NAs between lines mean we have a good boundary between paragraphs.\nAdditionally, I cross-referenced the novel order with the Canon of Sherlock Holmes in order to understand the order in which these works were published. I think it could be interesting to see if there are changes that occur between earlier works and later works.  \n\nparagraphs &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(paragraph = cumsum(is.na(text))) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(text)) |&gt;\n  group_by(book,paragraph) |&gt;\n  summarize(text = paste(text, collapse = \" \"))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'book'.

Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?\"\n\n\n7456\n\"There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to reason. You see my point?\"\n\n\n7457\nHolmes sprang from his chair.\n\n\n7458\n\"Get behind him, Watson! Don't let him out! Now, sir, let us see the contents of that note-book.\"\n\n\n7459\nMilverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and stood with his back against the wall.\n\n\n7460\n\"Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,\" he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. \"I have been expecting you to do something original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mistaken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.\" He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.\n\n\n7461\nHolmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. \"I'll be back some time, Watson,\" said he, and vanished into the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take.\n\n\n7462\nFor some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion.\n\n\n7463\n\"You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?\"\n\n\n7464\n\"No, indeed!\"\n\n\n7465\n\"You'll be interested to hear that I am engaged.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe analysis from Blatt that I’m interested in replicating is his exclamation point analysis.\nF.

From my position I could look over the case in the direction of the floor.

That said, there is one more method for normalization that is also worth considering. Hemingway would argue that most exclamation points should be replaced with periods. In addition to the above suggestion, I will also normalize by the dividing the sum of terminal periods and exclamation points. This one is a bit more tricky. I don’t want to count “Dr.” or “1.” as sentences. To correct for this, I will count periods immediately after a word that has at least one lowercase vowel.\n\nexclamation_points_normalization &lt;- paragraphs |&gt;\n  mutate(exclamation_points = str_count(text, \"!\"),\n         words = lengths(str_split(text, \" \")),\n         terminal_periods = str_count(text, \"\\\\b\\\\w*[aeiou]\\\\w*\\\\.\") #thanks chatGPT\n         )\nsample &lt;- exclamation_points_normalization |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  filter(exclamation_points &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  filter(terminal_periods &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n=5)\n\nsample |&gt; #Trust but verify\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Punctuation and Word Counts\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Punctuation and Word Counts\n\n\nbook\nparagraph\ntext\nexclamation_points\nwords\nterminal_periods\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches\n4088\n\"Mrs. Toller!\" cried Miss Hunter.\n1\n5\n1\n\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n9444\n\"Halloa, Beryl!\" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.\n1\n21\n1\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Dying Detective\n12766\n\"Admirable, Watson!

What a rag-bag of singular happenings! But surely the most valuable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual! This person is alone and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired. How is any news or any message to reach him from without? Obviously by advertisement through a newspaper. There seems no other way, and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here are the Daily Gazette extracts of the last fortnight. 'Lady with a black boa at Prince's Skating Club'--that we may pass. 'Surely Jimmy will not break his mother's heart'--that appears to be irrelevant. 'If the lady who fainted on Brixton bus'--she does not interest me. 'Every day my heart longs--' Bleat, Watson--unmitigated bleat! Ah, this is a little more possible. Listen to this: 'Be patient. Will find some sure means of communications. Meanwhile, this column. G.' That is two days after Mrs. Warren's lodger arrived. It sounds plausible, does it not? The mysterious one could understand English, even if he could not print it. Let us see if we can pick up the trace again. Yes, here we are--three days later. 'Am making successful arrangements. Patience and prudence. The clouds will pass. G.' Nothing for a week after that. Then comes something much more definite: 'The path is clearing. If I find chance signal message remember code agreed--One A, two B, and so on. You will hear soon. G.' That was in yesterday's paper, and there is nothing in to-day's. It's all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren's lodger.

He and his\n2023\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsecretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent. I\n2024\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nnoticed a \"Copenhagen\" label upon each of their trunks, showing that\n2025\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthat had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet\n2026\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nreserved man, but his employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.\n2027\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nHe was coarse in his habits and brutish in his ways. The very night\n2028\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nof his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed,\n2029\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nafter twelve o'clock in the day he could hardly ever be said to be\n2030\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsober.

Worst of all, he speedily assumed the same attitude\n2032\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ntowards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her more than once in a way\n2033\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwhich, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one\n2034\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noccasion he actually seized her in his arms and embraced her--an\n2035\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noutrage which caused his own secretary to reproach him for his\n2036\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nunmanly conduct.'\n2037\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2038\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"'But why did you stand all this,' I asked.

When I closed\n2055\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthe door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind. Alas,\n2056\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nin less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that\n2057\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nMr. Drebber had returned. He was much excited, and evidently the\n2058\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nworse for drink. He forced his way into the room, where I was sitting\n2059\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwith my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed\n2060\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nhis train. He then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed\n2061\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto her that she should fly with him. \"You are of age,\" he said, \"and\n2062\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nthere is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare. Never\n2063\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nmind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You\n2064\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshall live like a princess.\" Poor Alice was so frightened that she\n2065\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nshrunk away from him, but he caught her by the wrist and endeavoured\n2066\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nto draw her towards the door. I screamed, and at that moment my son\n2067\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nArthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard\n2068\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\noaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle. I was too terrified to\n2069\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nraise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the\n2070\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\ndoorway laughing, with a stick in his hand. \"I don't think that fine\n2071\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nfellow will trouble us again,\" he said. \"I will just go after him and\n2072\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nsee what he does with himself.\" With those words he took his hat and\n2073\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nstarted off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr.\n2074\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nDrebber's mysterious death.'\n2075\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nNA\n2076\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\n\"This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and\n2077\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\npauses. At times she spoke so low that I could hardly catch the\n2078\n\n\nA Study In Scarlet\nwords.

This will be particularly useful in understanding dialog because it is typical in literature to start a new paragraph each time a speaker changes. The NAs between lines mean we have a good boundary between paragraphs.\nAdditionally, I cross-referenced the novel order with the Canon of Sherlock Holmes in order to understand the order in which these works were published. I think it could be interesting to see if there are changes that occur between earlier works and later works.  \n\nparagraphs &lt;- data |&gt;\n  mutate(paragraph = cumsum(is.na(text))) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(text)) |&gt;\n  group_by(book,paragraph) |&gt;\n  summarize(text = paste(text, collapse = \" \"))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'book'.

Surely it is better for you to take the substantial sum which I offer than to ruin this woman's career, which can profit you in no way?\"\n\n\n7456\n\"There you make a mistake, Mr. Holmes. An exposure would profit me indirectly to a considerable extent. I have eight or ten similar cases maturing. If it was circulated among them that I had made a severe example of the Lady Eva I should find all of them much more open to reason. You see my point?\"\n\n\n7457\nHolmes sprang from his chair.\n\n\n7458\n\"Get behind him, Watson! Don't let him out! Now, sir, let us see the contents of that note-book.\"\n\n\n7459\nMilverton had glided as quick as a rat to the side of the room, and stood with his back against the wall.\n\n\n7460\n\"Mr. Holmes, Mr. Holmes,\" he said, turning the front of his coat and exhibiting the butt of a large revolver, which projected from the inside pocket. \"I have been expecting you to do something original. This has been done so often, and what good has ever come from it? I assure you that I am armed to the teeth, and I am perfectly prepared to use my weapons, knowing that the law will support me. Besides, your supposition that I would bring the letters here in a note-book is entirely mistaken. I would do nothing so foolish. And now, gentlemen, I have one or two little interviews this evening, and it is a long drive to Hampstead.\" He stepped forward, took up his coat, laid his hand on his revolver, and turned to the door. I picked up a chair, but Holmes shook his head and I laid it down again. With bow, a smile, and a twinkle Milverton was out of the room, and a few moments after we heard the slam of the carriage door and the rattle of the wheels as he drove away.\n\n\n7461\nHolmes sat motionless by the fire, his hands buried deep in his trouser pockets, his chin sunk upon his breast, his eyes fixed upon the glowing embers. For half an hour he was silent and still. Then, with the gesture of a man who has taken his decision, he sprang to his feet and passed into his bedroom. A little later a rakish young workman with a goatee beard and a swagger lit his clay pipe at the lamp before descending into the street. \"I'll be back some time, Watson,\" said he, and vanished into the night. I understood that he had opened his campaign against Charles Augustus Milverton; but I little dreamed the strange shape which that campaign was destined to take.\n\n\n7462\nFor some days Holmes came and went at all hours in this attire, but beyond a remark that his time was spent at Hampstead, and that it was not wasted, I knew nothing of what he was doing. At last, however, on a wild, tempestuous evening, when the wind screamed and rattled against the windows, he returned from his last expedition, and having removed his disguise he sat before the fire and laughed heartily in his silent inward fashion.\n\n\n7463\n\"You would not call me a marrying man, Watson?\"\n\n\n7464\n\"No, indeed!\"\n\n\n7465\n\"You'll be interested to hear that I am engaged.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThe analysis from Blatt that I’m interested in replicating is his exclamation point analysis.\nF. Scott Fitzgerald and Earnest Hemingway were known for their very resvered use of exclamation points. Fizgerald describes it as “Laughing at your own joke.” We can use this data to determine how well Arthur Conan Doyle follows this rule.  \n\nexclamation_points &lt;- paragraphs |&gt;\n  mutate(exclamation_points = str_count(text, \"!\"))\n\nexclamation_point_sample &lt;- exclamation_points |&gt;\n  filter(exclamation_points &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n = 5)\n\n### showing some example lines as a sanity check to make sure our code is working\n\nexclamation_point_sample |&gt;\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Lines with Exclamation Points\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Lines with Exclamation Points\n\n\nbook\nparagraph\ntext\nexclamation_points\n\n\n\n\nThe Valley Of Fear\n11505\nEttie threw her arms round her lover's neck. \"Give it up, Jack!

From comparing notes afterwards it was but an hour and a quarter, yet it appeared to me that the night must have almost gone and the dawn be breaking above us. My limbs were weary and stiff, for I feared to change my position; yet my nerves were worked up to the highest pitch of tension, and my hearing was so acute that I could not only hear the gentle breathing of my companions, but I could distinguish the deeper, heavier in-breath of the bulky Jones from the thin, sighing note of the bank director.

That said, there is one more method for normalization that is also worth considering. Hemingway would argue that most exclamation points should be replaced with periods. In addition to the above suggestion, I will also normalize by the dividing the sum of terminal periods and exclamation points. This one is a bit more tricky. I don’t want to count “Dr.” or “1.” as sentences. To correct for this, I will count periods immediately after a word that has at least one lowercase vowel.\n\nexclamation_points_normalization &lt;- paragraphs |&gt;\n  mutate(exclamation_points = str_count(text, \"!\"),\n         words = lengths(str_split(text, \" \")),\n         terminal_periods = str_count(text, \"\\\\b\\\\w*[aeiou]\\\\w*\\\\.\") #thanks chatGPT\n         )\nsample &lt;- exclamation_points_normalization |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  filter(exclamation_points &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  filter(terminal_periods &gt; 0) |&gt;\n  slice_sample(n=5)\n\nsample |&gt; #Trust but verify\n  gt() |&gt;\n  tab_header(title = \"Sample of Punctuation and Word Counts\") |&gt;\n  opt_stylize(style = 6, color = \"gray\") |&gt;\n  tab_options(container.height = \"300px\", container.overflow.y = \"scroll\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample of Punctuation and Word Counts\n\n\nbook\nparagraph\ntext\nexclamation_points\nwords\nterminal_periods\n\n\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Copper Beeches\n4088\n\"Mrs. Toller!\" cried Miss Hunter.\n1\n5\n1\n\n\nThe Hound of the Baskervilles\n9444\n\"Halloa, Beryl!\" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his greeting was not altogether a cordial one.\n1\n21\n1\n\n\nThe Adventure of the Dying Detective\n12766\n\"Admirable, Watson!

What a rag-bag of singular happenings! But surely the most valuable hunting-ground that ever was given to a student of the unusual! This person is alone and cannot be approached by letter without a breach of that absolute secrecy which is desired. How is any news or any message to reach him from without? Obviously by advertisement through a newspaper. There seems no other way, and fortunately we need concern ourselves with the one paper only. Here are the Daily Gazette extracts of the last fortnight. 'Lady with a black boa at Prince's Skating Club'--that we may pass. 'Surely Jimmy will not break his mother's heart'--that appears to be irrelevant. 'If the lady who fainted on Brixton bus'--she does not interest me. 'Every day my heart longs--' Bleat, Watson--unmitigated bleat! Ah, this is a little more possible. Listen to this: 'Be patient.

The mysterious one could understand English, even if he could not print it. Let us see if we can pick up the trace again. Yes, here we are--three days later. 'Am making successful arrangements. Patience and prudence. The clouds will pass. G.' Nothing for a week after that. Then comes something much more definite: 'The path is clearing. If I find chance signal message remember code agreed--One A, two B, and so on. You will hear soon. G.' That was in yesterday's paper, and there is nothing in to-day's. It's all very appropriate to Mrs. Warren's lodger.
