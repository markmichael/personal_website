Hi, I'm Mark. I'm a Seattle-based product manager with a background in medicine. I have opinions about healthcare, technology, cycling, and other things. <br> <br>
Most recently, I've been building [Harvvest](https://harvvest.app), a platform that helps influencers monetize their content by connecting them with brands for them to promote. <br> <br>
